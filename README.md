# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat compile
yarn run ts-node --files .\scripts\MyToken.ts frutilla vainilla chocolate
```
